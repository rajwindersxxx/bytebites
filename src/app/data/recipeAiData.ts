  "summary": "This Spicy Sweet Egg Toast is a quick and easy breakfast or snack option that combines the savory flavors of Maggi masala and chili with a touch of sweetness. It's a fusion dish, blending Indian spices with the classic French toast concept. The recipe is ready in just 10 minutes, making it perfect for busy mornings or a quick afternoon bite.\n\n_Egg_ provides a good source of protein, while _milk_ adds calcium. The addition of **Maggi masala** brings a unique umami flavor and a hint of spice from the _chili powder_. The _sugar_ balances the flavors, creating a pleasant sweet-savory profile.\n\nThis toast can be enjoyed any time of day, but it is especially popular as a **breakfast** or **brunch** item. For a healthier twist, use whole-wheat bread and reduce the amount of sugar.\n\nIf you prefer a richer flavor, you can add a splash of vanilla extract to the egg mixture or sprinkle some cheese on top while cooking. Similar recipes include classic French toast, savory egg toast with herbs, or a masala omelet. For an adult version consider pairing it with a dry sparkling wine to cut through the richness of the egg. Enjoy the explosion of flavors in every bite!\n```\n",
